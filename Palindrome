//Example 1:

//Input: x = 121
//Output: true
//Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
//Example 2:

//Input: x = -121
//Output: false
//Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
//Example 3:

//Input: x = 10
//Output: false
//Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
